# Skin Cancer Classification using HAM10000 Dataset 🧴🧬

This project leverages deep learning (CNNs) to classify skin lesions using the **HAM10000** dataset. It aims to assist in the early detection of skin cancer by identifying various types of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Skin cancer is among the most common types of cancer. Accurate early detection using deep learning can improve diagnosis and treatment planning. In this project:

- We use the **HAM10000** dataset with over 10,000 dermatoscopic images.
- The images are classified into 7 categories of skin lesions.
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to perform multi-class classification.
